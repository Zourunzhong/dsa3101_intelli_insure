Assignment 1 - employ use of treebased model to solve a business problem
With my internship experience in BOS, I have gained a better understanding of how data solutions can truly offer business value, by interfacing it with a webapp.
I have always questioned how complex data science techniques can be accessed by the layman business user, when it requires technical skill to operate it, and the answer is they simply cannot. 
All mentioned content in this git is solely my effort alone & thus it is a subset of the full content. 

# My technical applications in this project
Additionally, I was responsible for the choice of data science model and 
- I choose random forest classifier despite of XGBoost for as I could still reap the benefits of ensemble method, but the former could be better understood by my groupmates, as there was a differential in the applied skills of members due to randomised grouping in this module.
 
- I also employed GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning on the RFClassifier. To note, deepnote's cpu for the free account is rather weak and probably lacks the ability to do parallel computation. It took 33mins to perform 360 counts. on my i5-11300, it took slightly more than a minute, with the same Grid Space

- experimented with VIF to detect multi-collinearity in columns

- experimented with the use of SpearmanR correlation to detect monotonic correlation between viariables, visualised using a dendrogram

- I was the sole contributor in terms of ideation & developing of my webapp solution(mock up). Additional features to benefit users were also thought up by me. 

# Do consider my slides in the space below
## Slides
1. My concern was with guiding the eyes of the audience to the different features of the webapp, there needed to be animations to guide the sequence of the webapps features. This also boosted engagement.
2. Features also required to be zoomed in so that the audience could see features clearly.
3. My final concern was with convincing the audience that the app was important, addressed users needs, key pain points as well as integrated itself and offered added value through the auxiliary functions. It also had to generate business value since we were building to solve a business problem in mind.
